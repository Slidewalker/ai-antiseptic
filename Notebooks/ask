Ask AI Antiseptic: What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything according to the sources?

Thinking...

Answer

According to the official user manual located in sources/manual.pdf:

> “Made with love (and a little 42) by the open-source community.”

Additionally, the manual explicitly references the number 42 in its closing line as a deliberate nod to Douglas Adams’ *The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*, where 42 is famously declared the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

So, according to your current AI Antiseptic knowledge base, the answer is definitively **42**.

(Your sources know what’s up.)
